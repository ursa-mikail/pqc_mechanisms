# Moving Beyond Trapdoors
The Old Way (Trapdoors): Methods like RSA rely on a mathematical "trapdoor." It's easy to compute in one direction (encryption) but very hard to reverse (decryption) unless you know a secret (the trapdoor). The risk is that someone might find a way to "pick the lock" (e.g., with a powerful quantum computer).

The New Way (Post-Quantum): New algorithms are based on mathematical problems believed to be hard even for quantum computers. They don't use trapdoors.
